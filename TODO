- top image on index

sort next/prev on headline slideshow on index.html
sort category-options - breaks what's behind it. test.

tell tom:
size-v looks bit better on desktop about us
category-bar active shown on about-us page
index has the category dropdown. but a bit funny for the slider behind it. make topbar active to see it
category-options needs colours correct for active anchor class.
Caret colour of search bar can't be blue with CSS alone - needs js
Put 'active' class in and out of topbar-icon (share/topbar-options)
